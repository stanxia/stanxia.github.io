<p>EMMANUEL MACRON, the president of France, was already dealing with national protests when a massive fire broke out at the Notre Dame cathedral, an 850-year old Parisian landmark. Can the tragedy, and Mr Macron’s leadership, bring the country together? America’s armed forces often don’t know how many civilians are killed in its air-strike campaigns—but that’s changing, thanks to pressure from the Pentagon’s loudest critics. And, though the Trump administration has cancelled a deal for Cuban baseball players, that won’t stop them making their way to the big leagues. Runtime: TK min.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Erasmus | Apr 16th 2019</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE CATHEDRAL of Notre Dame in Paris, and the vast outpouring of sorrow over its semi-destruction by fire on April 15th, epitomises the power of great houses of prayer to touch and inspire people. More palpably than any other kind of monument, they connect visitors with another world: one in which the finest composers, singers, sculptors, glass-makers, embroiderers and craft-workers of a given era joyfully mixed their energies in a vast, disinterested enterprise. </p>
<p>To some degree, that enterprise continues as long as the building stands. That alone makes great historic churches a source of fascination, even for those with little interest in Christian worship. People want them to be there, even if they don’t wish to share the cost or join the prayers.  </p>
<p>In almost every country in Europe, that creates an acute problem. The cost of maintaining the delicate stone fabric of a cathedral seems to rise geometrically, far out-stripping the ability of small congregations to sustain them. Governments and other secular bodies are minded to help but they also feel compelled, in most places, to respect the independence of the buildings’ historic stewards, in other words the churches.  </p>
<p>In England, the established church boasts 42 cathedrals (technically defined as the seat of a bishop), of which 39 are listed as historic buildings whose preservation is both mandated by law and entitled to some public help. (About 12,000 of the 16,000 other places of worship controlled by the Church of England are also listed.) </p>
<p>The Church of England likes to call the cathedrals one of its “success stories” with rising numbers of worshippers and visitors, and growing revenue. But as a recent report led by a bishop delicately put it, “recent failures of governance and management within a small number of cathedrals have highlighted vulnerabilities across the sector…” In plain language, at least two cathedrals have run into severe financial difficulties, which better stewardship might have avoided.</p>
<p>English cathedrals are relatively independent bodies, run by a cleric known as a dean who relies on a group of advisers known as a chapter. They are free to raise money in many ways, from concerts to exhibitions to simply charging an admission fee, as about a quarter of them do. In recent weeks Derby Cathedral raised eyebrows by hosting films that included graphic sex scenes and depictions of paganism.</p>
<p>Churches in Germany have an advantage. The system of religious taxes (under which people of Catholic or Lutheran heritage pay a levy to their respective denominations) has ensured an ample income stream. Germany’s religious masters have done better at hauling in revenue than at retaining worshippers, the figures would suggest.</p>
<p>But a massive fund-raising effort, drawing in generous private-sector donors and ordinary well-wishers in Germany and Britain, was needed for one of the biggest church reconstruction projects of modern times: the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche in Dresden.</p>
<p>This showpiece of German Baroque was destroyed, along with much of the city, in a British bombing raid in February 1945. The project, completed in 2005, was a complement to the erection in 1962 of a new cathedral in Coventry, replacing the one wrecked by a German air raid on the English Midlands.</p>
<p>Most European states subsidise their historically dominant Christian denominations, directly or indirectly, while also leaving the sects’ religious masters relatively autonomous. In Italy, despite the notional separation of Catholic church and state, the two are deeply intertwined, through tax breaks and state help for maintaining the artistic heritage which is one of Italy’s greatest tourist draws. Belgium offers generous help to all its main religions, but Catholic cathedrals still charge stiff admission fees as though they were museums.</p>
<p>In church-state relations, France is an outlier. Under the regime of laïcité, or strict secularism, municipalities took over formal responsibility for Catholic churches; clerics and their congregations are merely users. And clerics, in particular, are thin on the ground. In rural France, it is common for a priest to look after 30 old churches.</p>
<p>That paucity of active users prompts municipal authorities to assign a low priority to conserving church buildings. In 2013 a huge neo-Gothic church in the northern French town of Abbeville was dramatically demolished by municipal leaders, who said the place was a safety hazard and too expensive to repair. Hundreds of other French churches may soon have a similar fate. Nor have France’s state authorities done very well at protecting houses of prayer from a wave of vandalism, including arson and desecration, that has afflicted them this year.</p>
<p>Indeed, all over western Europe, churches are closing for lack of worshippers. In the Netherlands, a cardinal predicted in 2013 that two-thirds of the Roman Catholic churches in the country would shut by 2025.</p>
<p>But a diametrically opposing trend is at work further east in Europe. Perhaps the most spectacular act of church reconstruction of recent times was the re-erection of Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, which was dynamited by Stalin in 1931 and thrown back up over five years starting in 1995. It was rebuilt in about a tenth of the time needed for the original construction.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Russia, under a crash building programme decreed by the Russian Orthodox church, at least three new churches are said to be opening per day. And in other parts of central and eastern Europe, from Serbia to Georgia, vast new Orthodox churches now adorn capital cities which were already endowed with many places of prayer.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Russian church building spree extends far beyond the borders of the motherland. Anyone who takes a short walk along the banks of the Seine from the wreckage of Notre Dame will soon see a boldly modernistic structure, topped with onion domes: this “spiritual and cultural” centre, opened in 2016, was a pet project of President Vladimir Putin’s. It competes hard with an older Russian-style cathedral in Paris which the Muscovite authorities, to their frustration, do not control. </p>
<p>As the Russian state media were eager to point out, western Europe is gaining some new Christian places of worship even as many others are destroyed, accidentally or otherwise.</p>

<p>Apr 11th 2019</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following months of mass protests in Sudan, it appeared that Omar al-Bashir had been ousted as president by the army. Mr al-Bashir had misruled since taking power in a coup in 1989. His civil war against non-Muslim black Africans ended with the secession of South Sudan. Separately, the International Criminal Court charged him with overseeing genocide in Darfur. See article. </p>
<p>Binyamin Netanyahu won a record fifth term as prime minister of Israel. His Likud party tied with Blue and White, a centrist rival. But the right-wing and religious bloc, of which Likud is a part, won a majority of seats in the Knesset. In the final days of the campaign Mr Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank, further dimming the prospect of any peace with the Palestinians based on a two-state solution. See here and here. </p>
<p>Khalifa Haftar, Libya’s most powerful warlord, attacked Tripoli, which is controlled by the UN-backed government. Dozens of people were killed in the fighting, as militias allied to the government rallied to defend the capital. A UN peace conference, scheduled for this month, was postponed. See article. </p>
<p>Protests continued in Algeria, where crowds called for the resignation of Abdelkader Bensalah, the interim president. Mr Bensalah succeeded Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who resigned amid widespread anger at his regime after 20 years in charge. For the first time police used tear-gas to disperse the demonstrators. Mr Bensalah said the country would hold a presidential election on July 4th.</p>
<p>Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister, attended a summit in Brussels to discuss another delay to Brexit. The European Union offered Britain six more months, pushing the deadline to October 31st, Halloween. That means Britain faces having to vote in elections to the European Parliament next month, though British MEPs will have to step down if Brexit actually happens. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, joked that if there was another late-night meeting on the last day of the talks he might have to leave at midnight; his term ends on November 1st. See article. </p>
<p>Julian Assange, a founder of WikiLeaks, was arrested by British police in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Ecuador had granted Mr Assange refuge in 2012 after he had jumped bail while facing rape allegations. His relationship with his hosts soured after a change of government in Ecuador, where a leftist president was replaced by a more moderate one. Mr Assange has said he fears extradition to the United States, where WikiLeaks is not popular, having published reams of leaked American military secrets.</p>
<p>Turkey’s ruling party demanded a fresh vote in Istanbul, where it narrowly lost the mayoralty in elections on March 31st.</p>
<p>Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, announced the formation of a new nationalist group within the European Parliament, to be called the European Alliance for People and Nations. However, none of the party leaders he hoped would attend from other countries turned up.</p>
<p>The Trump administration cancelled a four-month-old agreement under which Cuban baseball players could join Major League teams in America without defecting from their country. The administration said the agreement would encourage human trafficking and help enrich Cuba’s communist government. See article. </p>
<p>Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, sacked the education minister, Ricardo Vélez, who shared his socially conservative views. Mr Vélez had courted controversy by instructing schools to film classes singing the national anthem and repeating Mr Bolsonaro’s campaign slogan. His replacement, Abraham Weintraub, an economist, has said that crack cocaine was introduced to Brazil deliberately by the left. See here. </p>
<p>Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of the Future Forward party, was charged with sedition in relation to a protest against Thailand’s military junta in 2015. It is one of several repressive steps that has marred the country’s supposed return to democracy after an election last month. See article. </p>
<p>Kassym Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s interim president following the sudden resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev after three decades in power, called a snap election for June 9th. See article. </p>
<p>South Korea’s constitutional court ruled that the government must end the country’s ban on abortion, in place since 1953, before the end of 2020. Doctors can currently be imprisoned if they perform the procedure. However, tens of thousands of abortions are carried out each year.</p>
<p>Voting began in India’s seven-stage election. The final phase will take place on May 19th and the results for all seven stages will be announced on May 23rd. Polls suggest the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party will remain the biggest party. See article. </p>
<p>A court in Hong Kong found nine people guilty of “public nuisance” charges relating to their leading roles in the Umbrella Movement of 2014, which involved weeks of sit-ins and demonstrations in busy commercial districts in support of democratic reform. Among the defendants were three founders of a group involved in the unrest. </p>
<p>Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as the secretary of America’s Department of Homeland Security. Donald Trump is trying to replace the department’s top officials with people who will try harder to keep Mexicans out of the United States. Mr Trump has threatened to close the border entirely, despite advice that this would cause economic chaos. See article. </p>
<p>Randolph Alles, the head of America’s Secret Service, is quitting. He had reportedly been asked to go before the recent security breach at Mr Trump’s private club, involving a Chinese woman with several thumb drives.</p>
<p>Amnesty International’s annual report on the death penalty recorded a drop of nearly a third in known executions worldwide last year. There were 690 in 2018, down from 1,061 in 2015. The number of death sentences passed by courts also declined slightly, though in the Middle East and north Africa death sentences nearly doubled to 1,170. The region is responsible for two-thirds of the world’s known executions. (China is also thought to execute thousands of people every year, but keeps its figures secret.) Of the countries that release figures, Iran is by far the most avid executioner, putting 409 people to death each year on average for the past decade.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prospero | Apr 16th 2019</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“FOSSE/VERDON”, a new mini-series about two Broadway legends, could have been a simple paean to the magic of the stage. Bob Fosse (Sam Rockwell), a director, and his wife Gwen Verdon (Michelle Williams), a dancer, helped to create hits such as “Damn Yankees!”, “Chicago” and “Cabaret”. There is plenty of exquisite choreography, as legs kick in perfect time and dazzling costumes shimmer on twisting bodies, plus a sparkling rendition of “Big Spender”. Elsewhere, in a fantasy scene, Fosse twirls effortlessly down a corridor, surrounded by colourful dancers.</p>
<p>But the show turns out to be a surprisingly moving examination of the characters of Fosse and Verdon, as well as their extraordinary careers. It opens with the build-up to “Cabaret”, Fosse’s best-known film, which he directed and choreographed in 1971. The viewer is transported from Hollywood to damp, dark Munich, where it was shot, and the pressure is palpable. The film cannot afford to be “another $20m fiasco”, a producer warns, referring to one of Fosse’s previous misses. Fosse, in turn, takes it out on his crew. “I wanna see every muscle, every tendon,” he barks during exhausting rehearsals for “Mein Herr”, one of the nightclub songs. After seeing the first cut, he moans to his assistant that “it’s unwatchable”. On the night of the premiere, he paces in the auditorium rather than watching the film (it was a box-office triumph and would go on to win eight Oscars). His personal torment, and abject terror of failure, is clear. </p>
<p>The programme dances back and forth in time. Title cards, such as “Hollywood: 19 years left” and “Gwen Verdon: 14 years after her last Tony award”, contextualise the scenes, which range across five decades. It allows the viewer to see patterns emerge. A flashback to Fosse’s childhood dance classes, for example—“don’t show me the effort, Bobby, don’t show me the sweat. All they wanna see is that smile”—helps to explain Fosse’s treatment of his own dancers. Depictions of his career highs jar with his descent into depression and alcoholism, as well as scenes of childhood abuse. His wild lifestyle of pills, sex, parties and more pills, is juxtaposed with images of Verdon feeding their daughter dinner and arranging child care. The effect is troubling, and powerful. </p>
<p>Mr Rockwell’s thoughtful and pained performance elicits a surprising amount of sympathy for Fosse, even as he behaves appallingly. One excruciating scene shows a lead dancer refusing his sexual advances; she is subsequently fired. But the decision to give Verdon equal billing in the production was a wise one (the series was originally adapted from “Fosse”, a biography written in 2013, but the producers realised that this would result in a narrow, uneven story). She emerges as a quiet kind of hero, helped by an elegant performance by Ms Williams. </p>
<p>Verdon, as well as being Fosse’s long-suffering wife, was his creative collaborator. Her career peaked in the 1950s, when she won a string of Tony awards, but she gradually lost her hold over Hollywood and was eventually eclipsed by her husband. Yet when “Cabaret” hits a crisis—the endless rehearsals are ruining the shooting schedule, and the budget—it is Verdon that Fosse needs, begging her to come and join him in Germany. She sweeps in, taking charge of hair and make-up and fine-tuning the dancing. Where Fosse had used the dancers as moving props, Verdon makes them into fleshed-out characters with backstories. As such, “Fosse/Verdon” reminds viewers that great feats are rarely accomplished alone (a theme that Lin-Manuel Miranda, an executive producer of the series, touched upon in “Hamilton”, his own musical hit). </p>
<p>Tributes to Tinseltown and Broadway, such as “La La Land”, often focus on the glamour and romanticism of it all. “Fosse/Verdon” is all the better for lifting the stage curtain to look at the people behind it. The series understands that while show business projects an image of human perfection, its masters are as flawed as they are brilliant.</p>
<p>“Fosse/Verdon” is showing on FX in America now. It will be released in Britain on BBC Two later this year</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Game theory | Apr 16th 2019</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FOR EVERY single week between August 2013 and September 2018, betting on Tiger Woods was a losing proposition. Owing to a series of injuries and over-use of pain-killing prescription drugs, golf’s biggest star went five years without winning a single tournament. So in hindsight, it looks like remarkably poor timing that the The Economist ran an article pouring cold water on Mr Woods’s chances of winning the Masters Tournament in precisely the week that he wound up ending his 11-year-long drought in major championships. “Our Masters forecast is lukewarm on Tiger Woods”, read the headline on the online version of the story, which ended by declaring it “more likely than not that he has let loose his last roar”.</p>
<p>Before the tournament began, betting markets gave Mr Woods a 5% chance to win. That was more than twice the 2.2% estimate produced by EAGLE, our statistical golf prediction model. Did punters know something that the computer did not?</p>
<p>EAGLE may well have under-estimated the probability that the man who once played the game better than anyone else in history would re-capture his mojo. However, close scrutiny of Mr Woods’s showing at the Masters suggests that rather than channelling vintage Tiger, he delivered a merely excellent tournament, not one for the ages. His performance was easily within the capacity of any top-ten golfer, and one that in general is not sufficient to win a major.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr Woods’s four days in Georgia were not even his own best work at a major since he returned to action. Last year at the PGA Championship, Mr Woods played well enough to win, but was stymied by a competitor who was just a bit better. This time, in contrast, he put in nearly as good an effort, while all of the other contenders in a wide-open field made costly errors at crucial moments.</p>
<p>The prodigal son returns Although EAGLE was far less bullish on Mr Woods than bettors were, the model was actually rather impressed by his comeback. After adjusting for course conditions and difficulty, Mr Woods’s average scores since he returned from injury in December 2017 were the tenth-best in the world during that period. EAGLE ranked him as the ninth-best golfer in this year’s Masters field, with an expected score of 0.36 strokes above par per round under standard conditions for a major tournament.</p>
<p>There is so much round-to-round variability intrinsic to golf that over a mere 72 holes, the best player in the world at the start of a major tournament rarely emerges victorious. EAGLE regarded Dustin Johnson as the leader of the Masters pack by a comfortable margin, but still gave him just an 8% chance to win. (At the tail end of his peak, Mr Woods towered so far above the competition that he reached seemingly unthinkable victory odds around 25%. No one has approached that level since.) Instead, the champion usually emerges from the cluster of players ranked between fifth and 30th—though determining exactly which one of them fortune will smile upon is a fool’s errand. By EAGLE’s estimate, the current version of Mr Woods plays at almost exactly the average skill level of major winners. Then again, so do competitors like Paul Casey and Sergio García, who both wound up buried at the bottom of the Masters leaderboard.</p>
<p>Rather than unfounded scepticism about Mr Woods’s ability, EAGLE’s estimate of his chances fell short of those of betting markets for two reasons. The first is that in the model’s calculation, punters tend to over-value all elite or well-known players, while under-estimating those of long-shots. The ranks of major champions include almost all of the greats, but also out-of-nowhere upstarts. In 2009 the unheralded Y.E. Yang rallied from a seven-stroke deficit to beat Mr Woods at the 2009 PGA Championship, which by EAGLE’s estimate was the most improbable major victory of the 21st century. Two years later, Darren Clarke was ranked 111th in the world when he won his first and only major at the Open Championship in England at the age of 42.</p>
<p>Individually, each low-ranked competitor has only a slim chance of victory. Collectively, however, their probability tends to be greater—and thus, the chances of the favourites are lower—than the prices on peer-to-peer betting exchanges suggest. Based on EAGLE’s calculations, the most profitable bet ahead of the Masters was to wager on a stumble by Rory McIlroy, who was heavily favoured in betting markets to win the tournament. Mr McIlroy wound up finishing 21st, offering a healthy pay-out to doubters—including your correspondent—who took odds of 2.5-to-one (a 29% probability) or better that he would fail to make the top 20. EAGLE reckoned his chances of such a disappointing result were just under 50%.</p>
<p>The second explanation for EAGLE’s relative pessimism is that unlike bettors, the model treats all players with similar scores over the past few years similarly—regardless of whether or not they happen to be named Tiger Woods. Punters priced Mr Woods as the third or fourth most likely player to win the tournament, a conclusion impossible to justify based solely on his record since 2017. The only way to arrive at such a lofty valuation was to bake in a significant probability that he would recover the form he last displayed nearly a decade ago. As prescient as that looks in hindsight, could it really have been justified in advance?</p>
<p>EAGLE takes a straightforward approach to weighting historical scores: every day, each round result in its database loses about 0.25% of its impact. Scores from a week ago are counted about 98% as much as ones from today; those a month old are worth 93%; those a full year in the past get 41%; and those two years back are assigned 16%. On one hand, this “decay rate”, optimised to produce the most accurate forecasts over the model’s entire dataset of over 1m rounds, looks surprisingly gentle. Few analysts pay attention to scores from even six months ago, not to mention those from two years in the past. But given the length of Mr Woods’s decline phase and absences from the game, the weight EAGLE puts on scores from the last time he won a tournament in 2013 rounds to zero.</p>
<p>For most golfers, ignoring results over six years old would be sensible. But Mr Woods, as always, is a special case. He was ailing during many of the rounds he did play in the intervening years, making those results poor predictors of how he might perform when healthy. Moreover, he might have needed to re-discover his touch during the first months of his comeback. In theory, a well-designed model would need to give him credit for his proven potential, while discounting the importance of scores recorded before he settled into form.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the particulars of Mr Woods’s journey mitigate many of these concerns. Because he barely played in the two years to November 2017, EAGLE’s time-decay function already caused it to disregard the poor scores Mr Woods recorded before his time off. And rather than gaining ground incrementally once he came back en route to his climactic Masters triumph, the rejuvenated star emerged fully formed, like Athena springing from the head of Zeus, from the moment he resumed play. In the first six tournaments he played upon his return, he finished second, fifth, ninth, 12th and 23rd, with only one missed cut—a run that would make a golfer half his age proud. During the following year, he maintained that level of performance—one consistent with a top-ten player, rather than a top-five one—but did not improve upon it.</p>
<p>Fans of Mr Woods will surely insist that this approach sells their hero short. So as a check on EAGLE’s method, consider a thought experiment. Suppose that back in 2009, when Mr Woods announced he would take a break from golf to repair his broken personal life, that hiatus had lasted for a decade rather than for just a few months. How might we have predicted him to perform in 2019, knowing nothing but how he had played at his peak?</p>
<p>Ageing curves are far gentler in golf than in most other sports—no one blinks an eye when a 40-something golfer wins a tournament. But that does not mean that time exacts no toll at all. On the contrary, golfers generally play significantly better in their 30s than in their 40s.</p>
<p>Since records for the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) began in 1986, there have been 16 players other than Mr Woods who were in the top ten just before turning 34—Mr Woods’s age when the scandal broke—and were still active at Mr Woods’s current age of 43 years and three and a half months. Just two of them, Phil Mickelson and Greg Norman, were still in the top ten nine years later, and only three more (Colin Montgomerie, Ernie Els and Jim Furyk) managed to stay in the top 25.</p>
<p>Overall, after translating their world rankings into expected scores to par under typical conditions, the average member of this group lost 1.47 strokes per round between the ages of 34 and 43. And just before his infidelity scandal became public, Mr Woods was playing at a level of some 1.19 strokes below par per round. If you add on 1.47 strokes per round for nine years of ageing, you get an estimate of 0.28 strokes above par per 18 holes today—just a hair better than the rate of 0.36 EAGLE derived from Mr Woods’s scoring record during the past 16 months. In other words, Mr Woods’s ability has declined at almost exactly the same rate as that of comparable players from previous eras, albeit from a much higher starting point.</p>
<p>Raining on Tiger’s parade No matter how you slice it, Mr Woods looked like a strong but not top-tier contender when the tournament began. But when the facts change, nimble forecasters change their minds. Now that Mr Woods has donned the Masters victor’s green jacket, surely we can proclaim him “back” and resume debate over how long Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major championships is likely to stand—right?</p>
<p>Not so fast. A useful concept in sports forecasting, devised by Bill James, a baseball statistician, is “signature significance”—the notion that some achievements are so remarkable that only the elites can accomplish them, even in very small samples of data. A good example in golf would be beating the average score in a major over four rounds by more than 20 strokes. Since 1960, the two best players in history (Mr Woods and Mr Nicklaus) have each done so twice. Mr Woods broke the mark at the 2000 US Open and 1997 Masters, while Mr Nicklaus did at the 1965 Masters and the 1977 Open Championship in Scotland—the notorious “Duel in the Sun” that he somehow managed to lose. The only other golfers to surpass this threshold are the all-time greats Tom Watson (who beat Mr Nicklaus that day), Raymond Floyd, Arnold Palmer and Phil Mickelson—and one merely good player, Henrik Stenson, who had a great tournament when thwarting Mr Mickelson at the 2016 Open Championship.</p>
<p>If Mr Woods had come anywhere close to exceeding the field average by 20 strokes, EAGLE would have immediately elevated him to the very top tier of its rankings. In fact, his score was quite pedestrian by the standards of major winners. All major victories may count the same, but not all of them are equally impressive. Sometimes, the champion dominates wire to wire, as Mr Woods did at the 2000 US Open, which he won by an astonishing margin of 15 strokes. But, just as often, a golfer sneaks to victory with a solid performance when his closest competitors stumble.</p>
<p>All keen golf fans remember Mr Watson’s run at the 2009 Open Championship, when, at the age of 59, he led by a stroke with one hole to play, before bogeying and losing in a playoff to Stewart Cink. But the reason why the all-but-geriatric Mr Watson came that close to winning was that no one managed to beat the field average by even eight strokes. In the vast majority of tournaments, Mr Cink’s scorecard would not have come anywhere close to victory. But he had the good fortune to play somewhat better than average over four days when everyone else was off their game.</p>
<p>Mr Woods’s recent Masters victory was not quite as underwhelming as Mr Cink’s, but it was not far off. Although his finishing score of 275 looks impressive, the average score among golfers making the cut was a three-under-par 285. Unsurprisingly, there were lots of strong players right on Mr Woods’s heels, all of whom had numerous opportunities to tie with or beat him.</p>
<p>It would be hard to argue that Mr Woods’s scorecard at the 2019 Masters was more impressive than Mr Nicklaus’s losing effort at the Duel in the Sun, or Mr Mickelson’s runner-up showing to Mr Stenson in 2016. One way to quantify these differences is to take a player’s score above average, and then adjust it for tournament conditions and rules that cause scores either to spread out widely or to bunch closely together. (In general, the range of scores has grown more compressed over time, with the introduction of cut rules accelerating this trend. And events in which more players make the cut enable more mediocre golfers to post finishing scores, increasing the gap between the victor’s score and the field average.) This modified score above average can then be converted into a probability of winning a tournament. In general, players who beat the field average by 18 adjusted strokes go on to win about 95% of the time, those who exceed it by 13.5 strokes have a 50/50 chance, and ones who only surpass it by nine strokes are just under 5% to win.</p>
<p>By this measure, Mr Woods’s career tally of major titles has generally hewed fairly closely to the probabilities suggested by his scorecards. He won all eight times his probability was 80% or higher, four of the six times it was between 50% and 80%, and two of the eight times it was between 10% and 50%.</p>
<p>His showing at the 2019 Masters, however, is an extreme outlier. In general, players who amass his total of ten adjusted strokes better than the field average go on to win just 8.2% of the time. Mr Woods, of course, had to play well to put himself in contention. But on the final day, he also needed Francesco Molinari to deposit balls in the water on the 12th and 15th holes, Brooks Koepka to send a tee shot into Rae’s Creek on the 12th hole and miss a makeable birdie putt on the 18th, and Mr Johnson to see his furious charge on the back nine fall millimetres short of a final birdie on the 18th. The chances of all those misfortunes coming to pass at once were fairly low. As Mr Woods and Mr Molinari headed to the 12th hole on Sunday, EAGLE gave Mr Woods a 16% chance of emerging with the green jacket.</p>
<p>None of this is intended to take away from Mr Woods’s stirring victory—or even to suggest that he has benefited from exceptionally good luck on the whole during his comeback. Before his triumph at Augusta, he had come up just short at the previous two majors: the Open Championship and PGA Championship of 2018. At the former, where he was also paired with Mr Molinari on the final day, Mr Woods briefly secured the lead all to himself before miscues undid him on the back nine—just as they would do to his rivals at this year’s Masters. Mr Molinari emerged as the victor. In the latter tournament, it was Mr Woods who mounted a late push on the last day, similar to Mr Johnson’s this past weekend. He fell just short, when Mr Koepka proved himself immune to the type of mistakes he would go on to commit eight months later at Augusta. Although Mr Woods ended up as the bridesmaid at the PGA Championship and the bride at the Masters, his scorecard at the earlier tournament actually gave him a slightly better chance to win. His score of 266 was 10.66 adjusted strokes above the field average, and gave him a 12.5% chance of victory.</p>
<p>The second act goes on So where does that leave Mr Woods—and Mr Nicklaus’s record—going forward? If the last three majors are any guide, his most comparable players would be the other two champions in those events, both of whom Mr Woods has been in neck-and-neck races with on the final day: Mr Koepka and Mr Molinari. Mr Koepka has ascended to third in the OWGR, while Mr Molinari is seventh, one spot behind Mr Woods. All of those ranks are roughly consistent with a slight improvement on EAGLE’s take on Mr Woods before the Masters began: a top-ten player, but one below the top tier of Mr Johnson, Mr McIlroy and perhaps Justin Rose. That corresponds to a 2-4% chance of winning any given major, a 9% chance of winning another one this year, and a 50/50 chance of winning at least one more by the end of 2024—before accounting for the performance deterioration and greater risk of injury that ageing will inflict. In other words, Mr Nicklaus should probably rest easy. In all likelihood, Mr Woods was absent or injured for too many prime years to make a run at the all-time record.</p>
<p>It may look like consummate stubbornness for us to continue preaching caution on Mr Woods’s future, just two days after he made a mockery of such counsel. But accurate forecasting methods require a sound process and validation over long time periods, not over-reaction to short-run fluctuations. Unsurprisingly, bettors already exuberant about Mr Woods have bid him up further following his Masters victory: he, Mr Johnson and Mr McIlroy are all trading as co-favourites to win the PGA Championship next month. If that continues, we will probably bet against him—and look forward to suffering the financial and reputational consequences when the Greatest Of All Time™ makes EAGLE look silly once again.</p>

<p>ARTHUR MILLER did not aim to please his audiences. He reckoned that new ideas were a “humiliation” and an “affront” not only to people’s sensibilities but to their convictions, too. Like the ancient Greeks, Miller thought of drama as a “civic art”, a discipline that could contribute towards a state’s social and political progress. Unlike his contemporaries, he was not commercially minded. He said what no one else had the courage to, and his audiences would weep, or sit with their heads bowed. Irate patriots picketed theatres, and producers shied away from his work. Actors who appeared in his plays were shunned by their friends. </p>
<p>Miller’s observations hold true in the 21st century, particularly about the fallacy of the American Dream. Many still think of material wealth and status as essential to happiness, as Willy Loman does in “Death of a Salesman”. “The American Clock”, which reflects on the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression, is a reminder of the perils of short-termism. “The Price”, set 30 years later, focuses on the longer-term repercussions. In “All My Sons” Miller questions individualist thinking. “The Crucible” examines the destructive allure of ideologies.</p>
<p>Those insights, far from alienating today’s audiences, are now Miller’s selling points. Productions of his work have increased since his death in 2005, according to Susan Abbotson, the president of the Arthur Miller Society. He has been among the ten most-performed playwrights in American theatres for the past four years. Six productions of his work are currently being staged in London, an unusually high number for any playwright other than William Shakespeare. Tickets in the West End sell for as much as £142 ($186), a sum Miller would no doubt have been uncomfortable with given his belief that theatre should be affordable. Does this popularity suggest that his plays have lost their subversive edge?</p>
<p>Perhaps—time can dull even radical ideas. It is no longer shocking to hear that humans are doomed to repeat their mistakes. But Miller’s fashionableness also suggests that directors have stopped confronting their audiences, and have started pandering to them. A recent production at the Union Theatre of “An Enemy of the People”, Miller’s adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s play, had an image of President Donald Trump on its poster. The action was set in a contemporary “small-town Republican” community. Mayor Stockmann, a manipulative politician, dresses in a red suit, grinning and waving to chants of “USA! USA!” Miller never assigned a political persuasion to the play’s characters—he saw himself as a mediator, showing disparate groups what they have in common—but the suggestion here was that only Republicans can succumb to populist rhetoric and misinformation. This version of “An Enemy of the People” reinforced divisions, and allowed its audience to leave feeling smug.</p>
<p>Productions can also be too reverent of the source material. “The Price” (at Wyndham’s Theatre) strives for a historically accurate depiction of New York in the 1960s. The audience sees Gregory Solomon, a Russian-Jewish émigré, blessing his meagre lunch—a hard-boiled egg—in Hebrew. When the play was first performed in 1968, such details invited audiences to reflect on their city’s recent past, particularly the emotional fall-out from the boom and busts of the ‘20s and ‘30s. Now heightened for comic effect, they seem alien and strange. Miller wanted his plays to be relatable, not preserved in aspic—“there are museums for such activities,” he said—and so the setting must be familiar. In 2012 a production in Mumbai turned Solomon into a Muslim nonagenarian to great effect.</p>
<p>Miller’s plays provoked because they were about the audience as much as for them. “The Crucible” (pictured, at the Yard Theatre) opens with the townspeople of Salem dressed in the same style of clothing—beanie hats, baggy t-shirts, cargo trousers—as the audience of this edgy North London theatre. They are invited to confront an uncomfortable truth: any society, no matter how educated or tolerant it believes itself to be, can submit to hysteria. Reactions ranged from brow-furrowed confusion to wide-eyed fascination.</p>
<p>It is difficult for Miller’s plays to have the same effect today as when their themes were still unfamiliar, even taboo. Perhaps contemporary playwrights are better placed to touch modern nerves. But thoughtful stagings can continue to make audiences reflect on their own prejudices and shortcomings.</p>

<p>在生产中主力是使用 <code>IDEA</code> ，工欲善其事，必先利其器。因而总结一下在使用过程中的经验，为方便初学者更快的掌握这个神器。<br> <div class="note info"><h2 id="配置阿里云"><a href="#配置阿里云" class="headerlink" title="配置阿里云"></a>配置阿里云</h2></div><br>配置 <code>阿里云</code> 作为 <code>maven</code> 的仓库来源，原因大家都懂得，国外的仓库速度有时候很呵呵，国内的这方面还是靠谱点。</p>
<p>第一步：打开 IDEA 左上角的偏好设置 <code>Preferences</code>，接连点击 <code>Build</code> &gt;&gt; <code>Build Tools</code> &gt;&gt; <code>Maven</code> ，在 <code>Maven home directory</code> 处选择 IDEA 自带的 <code>maven</code> 版本，在本地文件系统中找到该路径，找到并进入 <code>conf</code> 目录，打开编辑 <code>settings.xml</code> 。</p>
<p>第二步：在 <code>settings.xml</code> 中搜索 <code>mirrors</code> ,将以下配置写入该处：<br><figure class="highlight xml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- 阿里amven库 --&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">mirror</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">id</span>&gt;</span>alimaven<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">id</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">name</span>&gt;</span>aliyun maven<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">name</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">url</span>&gt;</span>http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/groups/public/<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">url</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">mirrorOf</span>&gt;</span>central<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">mirrorOf</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">mirror</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<font color="red">NOTE:注意将上述代码放入 <code>&lt;mirrors&gt;这里面&lt;/mirrors&gt;</code> 。</font>

<p>第三步：回到 <code>Maven</code> 的配置界面，<code>User settings file</code> 处点击 <code>Override</code> ,选择刚才编辑的 <code>settings.xml</code> 文件全路径。</p>
<p>第四步：<code>Apply</code> ,<code>OK</code>,完活。现在可以验证是否成功。</p>

<p>Phoenix 是特别强大的，因为我们提供覆盖索引 - 一旦找到索引条目，我们不需要返回主表。相反，我们将我们关心的数据绑定到索引行，节省了读取时间的开销。</p>
<p>例如，以下内容将在v1和v2列上创建索引，并在索引中包含v3列以防止从数据表中获取该列：</p>

<p>Bigtable 是一个分布式的结构化数据存储系统，它被设计用来处理海量数据:通常是分布在数千台普通服务器上的 PB 级的数据。</p>
<p>Google 的很多项目使用 Bigtable 存储数据，包括 Web 索引、Google Earth、Google Finance。这些应用对 Bigtable 提出的要求差异非常大，无论是在数据量上(从 URL 到网页到卫星图像)还是在响应速度上(从后端的批量处理到实时数据服务)。尽管应用需求差异很大，但是，针对 Google 的这些产品，Bigtable 还是成功的提供了一个灵活的、高性能的解决方案。</p>
<p>本论文描述了 Bigtable 提供的简单的数据模型。利用这个模型，用户可以动态的控制数据的分布和格式。 我们还将描述 Bigtable 的设计和实现。<br>

<p>MapReduce 是一个编程模型，也是一个处理和生成超大数据集的算法模型的相关实现。用户首先创建一 个 Map 函数处理一个基于 key/value pair 的数据集合，输出中间的基于 key/value pair 的数据集合;然后再创建 一个 Reduce 函数用来合并所有的具有相同中间 key 值的中间 value 值。现实世界中有很多满足上述处理模型 的例子，本论文将详细描述这个模型。</p>
<p>MapReduce 架构的程序能够在大量的普通配置的计算机上实现并行化处理。这个系统在运行时只关心: 如何分割输入数据，在大量计算机组成的集群上的调度，集群中计算机的错误处理，管理集群中计算机之间 必要的通信。采用 MapReduce 架构可以使那些没有并行计算和分布式处理系统开发经验的程序员有效利用分 布式系统的丰富资源。</p>
<p>我们的 MapReduce 实现运行在规模可以灵活调整的由普通机器组成的集群上:一个典型的 MapReduce 计算往往由几千台机器组成、处理以 TB 计算的数据。程序员发现这个系统非常好用:已经实现了数以百计 的 MapReduce 程序，在 Google 的集群上，每天都有 1000 多个 MapReduce 程序在执行。<br>
